 <h2> About me </h2>
 
<p> Hi, I'm Camilo and I'm passionate about coding and web design. I recently completed a full stack developer bootcamp and I´m looking for new projects and experiences to grow up. I enjoy tackling challenges and learning from my experiences. In my free time, I enjoy reading, exploring, sports, and music. Whether it's discovering new authors, singers or hiking in the great outdoors, I'm always eager to explore and learn new things and I enjoy working in teams to achieve goals.
