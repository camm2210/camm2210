 <h2> About me </h2>
 
<p> Hi, I'm Camilo and I'm passionate about coding and web design. I recently completed a full stack developer bootcamp and enjoy tackling challenges and learning from my experiences. I'm always seeking ways to stay positive and motivated. I'm passionate about reading, exploring, engaging in sports and listening to music. I love immersing myself in new ideas and perspectives, and I find that physical activity and music help me stay energized and focused. Whether it's discovering new authors, singers or hiking in the great outdoors, I'm always eager to explore and learn new things. I enjoy working in teams to achieve goals, and I'm excited to learn more about your project or company and look forward to working together to achieve our goals!
